# emotion-based-music


Built an Emotion-based Music Recommendation Website which is an interactive web application that utilizes
facial emotion recognition to curate and play music on YouTube based on the user's mood.

The application allows users to input the singer's name and language preferences, and then it opens the webcam to detect the user's emotions in real-time. The detected emotion is then used to suggest and play
songs from YouTube that align with the user's current emotional state.

To run the website type this in the terminal:
streamlit run c:\Users\KASHNI\Downloads\emotion-based-music\music.py
